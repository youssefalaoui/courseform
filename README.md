# Courseform

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.1.

this is a simple form that detects: 
- If course name (input field) is filled and contains at least 5 characters length
- Checks if a select list value (Category select list) is chosen
- Shows Active submit button only if all the above-mentioned conditions are fullfiled. 
- At the end, it shows the form value - this is used for debugging for instance.
